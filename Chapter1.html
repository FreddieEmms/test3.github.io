            Starting your C# program can be one of the hardest things to do. A great way to start is to build a basic text story, which can be done using the Console.Writeline("<strong>Insert your text here</strong>"); . This instructs the console to write a line, which within the speech marks will tell it what to write. For example:
        </p>

            The code above is called a <strong>comment</strong>, which can be achieved in either one or two ways. The first is using two double slashes <strong>//</strong> (this will do it on one line only) and the other is using <strong>/* Insert text */</strong> (this can be done over multiple lines). A comment can be used to write in text without affecting the program. This can be extremely helpful as it can show us what is happening in the program without affecting our program. Also, it can instruct other coders on what is happening in the program.

            <strong>User Challenge: Can you now write a basic program using the Console.Writeline(“”).</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="writeParagraph">
            To run your program, you can press F5 or you can click run program. Now if you are unfortunate, it may pop up that there is a system error and the program cannot run. This means that the program cannot understand your code as you may have made a mistake. Programs tend to be very strict about what you write and even if there is the smallest error it will not run. Fortunately, your code will be highlighted by an IDE and show that there is an error on that line. One common error is not including the semi-colon which instructs the program that a new command is being entered. Now, if an error did occur, change your code to the example above and then it should be fixed. 
        </p>
        <p class="writeParagraph">
            Now that you've fixed your code, for some users, it may quickly flash a box and then nothing happens. This is because we have no input into our program and if there is no input from the user then it will quickly print our code and shut down because it does not require us. To stop this we can use Console.Readline();. This means that a computer must wait for a response from the user (which in this case an entry to make us continue). This can be used multiple times to add pauses and soon we will use it to assign inputs to variables!
        </p>
        <p class="finalLine">
            Another way to write your code is using Console.Write("…"); , now instead of writing the code onto a new line each, this will make it so that it will be written on the same line. Try these new techniques out!
